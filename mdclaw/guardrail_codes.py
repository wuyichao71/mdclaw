"""Single source of truth for MDClaw guardrail ``code`` values.

MDClaw's weak-agent contract is: branch on stable ``code`` strings, never on
human-readable messages. ``GUARDRAIL_CODES`` maps every agent-facing ``code``
the package can emit to a one-line recommended action.

Invariants (enforced by tests):

- Every ``code`` literal emitted anywhere under ``mdclaw/`` must be a key here
  (``tests/test_guardrail_code_registry.py``).

When adding a new guardrail code, add it here with a concise, imperative,
agent-facing action.
